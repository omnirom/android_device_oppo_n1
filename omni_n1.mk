# This file is the build configuration for a full Android
# build for grouper hardware. This cleanly combines a set of
# device-specific aspects (drivers) with a device-agnostic
# product configuration (apps).
#

# Sample: This is where we'd set a backup provider if we had one
# $(call inherit-product, device/sample/products/backup_overlay.mk)

# Get the prebuilt list of APNs
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/gsm.mk)

# Inherit from the common Open Source product configuration
$(call inherit-product, $(SRC_TARGET_DIR)/product/aosp_base_telephony.mk)

# Inherit from our custom product configuration
$(call inherit-product, vendor/omni/config/common.mk)

# Inherit from hardware-specific part of the product configuration
$(call inherit-product, device/oppo/n1/device.mk)

# Discard inherited values and use our own instead.
PRODUCT_NAME := omni_n1
PRODUCT_DEVICE := n1
PRODUCT_BRAND := Oppo
PRODUCT_MODEL := N1
PRODUCT_MANUFACTURER := Oppo

# Inline kernel
TARGET_KERNEL_SOURCE := kernel/oppo/apq8064
TARGET_KERNEL_CONFIG := n1_defconfig

# Inherit from proprietary blobs
$(call inherit-product-if-exists, vendor/oppo/n1/n1-vendor.mk)
